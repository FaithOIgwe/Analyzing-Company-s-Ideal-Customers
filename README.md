#Analyzing Company's Ideal Customers using Market Campaign Data

### Introduction 

Companies carryout marketing through several means for different reasons: to create more awareness  about their products and services, increase sales, get new customers, and also to be top of mind for their current customers and intending customers.

A marketing campaign is successful when the objective of the marketing is accomplished. To achieve this, a company must first understand their customers, so they can market apporpriately speaking the right language, and this all boils down to analyzing their historical data to understand their customers.

In this Project,I am a Data Analyst Consulting for a small business company to help them understand their ideal customers using their historical data from previous marketing campaigns.

### Problem Statement

In this project I take the position of a Marketign Data Analyst Consulting for a small business who sells retail products such as wines,Fruits, Fish products, sweet products, and Gold products. 

I have been provided with historical data of their past campaign, to analyze and help them better understand who their ideal customers are.

### Project Walkthrough
I first loaded the data and imported the needed libraries for this project, Carried out basic data cleaning tasks which involved replacing empty values with 0 and categorizing categorical data accordingly to aid and ease analysis.
After the initial data preprocessing or data cleaning, I moved into the analysis proper, whcich involved carrying out univariate analysis to first and better understand my data, next was to carry out a Bivariate Analysis, which involved combining two columns together to carryout my analysis, this was done using the correlation matrix to determine data that was correlated and then use the data to carryout this bivariate analysis.

Lastly, was to carryout a Multivariate Analysis still using the correlation matrix, but combining two and more columns together to furtehr investigate my data.

Conclusion and Recommendations

#### Our Average Customer Profile
Is a Master's degree holder, Married, in their 40s-70s, earns 35-68k per year and has 0 -1 child

#### Our most popular product types
Most of our customers spend the most on wine, followed by meat

Most of these customers who spend on meat, do so usually, using the catalogue.

These customers tend not to have kids.

#### What is our most popular sales channel
Our Customers prefer to make their purchases instore, followed by online purchase

#### What is the performance of our web sales channel?
Even if web is relatively popular as a sales channel, it is alarming that higher website visits don't result in higher web purchases, infact, there seems to be a slightly negative correlation between website visits and website purchases.

#### This needs to be looked into by the business, there could be something with our website that makes people click on the website, but make no purchases

#### Campaign Performance
Our best performing campaign is campaign 4, while campaign 2 recieved very poor results

#### Campaign 3 seems to be very attractive to customers with basic education, and it was also common with customers who had 1-2 kids or teens at home.

Lastly, customers with teens(at least one) at home really appreciated campaign 4

#### More Findings
A large portion of our customers are educated with at least a Master's Degree

The Higher education Column seems to be highly correlated with basic education.

Which makes me wonder if we as a business is not affordable for lower income customers

Customers with no kids seem to have higher income, which means that they might fit our targeted profile better. AS a result, it might make sense for us to figure out how to tap into their disposable income (that they have no kids to spend on!) with our campaigns

Finally one thought on recency, I didn't find any correlation between any campaign and recency, But I think potential future campaigns that get inactive customers making purchases could be interesting
